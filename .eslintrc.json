      http://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-param-reassign

      `no-param-reassign` prevents modifying variables declared as function
      parameters. However, most express middleware works by receiving and
      modifying request/response objects, so this rule needs to be relaxed.

      http://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-unused-vars

      `no-unused-vars` makes eslint complain if declared variables are not used
      anywhere. In express.js, all error-handling middleware must have arity 4
      (i.e. `err, req, res, next`), but `next` is rarely called. This causes
      linting errors, but if `next` is removed, the function will no longer act
      as an error-handler.
